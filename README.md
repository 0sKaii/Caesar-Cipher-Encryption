# Caesar Cipher - Task 01

This project is part of my **Cyber Security Internship** at [Prodigy InfoTech](https://prodigyinfotech.dev).  
In this task, I implemented the classic **Caesar Cipher** encryption algorithm using Python.

##  Description

The Caesar Cipher is a basic encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

This script:
- Accepts user input (CAPITAL letters only)
- Encrypts the input using a fixed shift of `k = 3`
- Outputs the encrypted text

##  Concepts Covered
- Basic cryptography principles
- ASCII value manipulation
- String processing in Python

##  How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/0sKaii/Caesar-Cipher-Encryption.git
